## **Project Overview**
The WeatherPy is a project which is developed to resolve the requirement for the client where they want to provide an option to the client to be able to provide ideal hotels for the travel or vacation based upon desired maximum and minimum temperature, across the globe. The suggested hotels should be in nearest city of those latitudes and longitudes selected randomly depending upon the temperature maximum and minimum range.
### **Purpose:**
The purpose of this project is to add weather description to the retrieved weather data for a PlanMyTrip App. The data will be filtered based upon weather preferences of the user in order to identify possible travel destinations and nearby hotels.

A travel itinerary will be created , of four cities, from the list of potential travel destinations. We will need to create a create a travel Destination map to achieve this objective. 

And, lastly, on the basis of chosen cities, we are required to create a travel route between those chosen four cities out of the potential travel destination list, as well as a marker layer map for the same.
## **WeatherPy Results**
Following information was retrieved showing a snapshot below of cities across the globe along with their weather conditions for 2000 random latitudes and longitudes.
